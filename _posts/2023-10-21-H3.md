# Statistic (practical assignment)

## Part a <br>
M systems are subject to a series of N attacks. On the x-axis, we indicate the attacks and on the Y-axis we
simulate the accumulation of a "security score" (-1, 1), where the score is -1 if the system is penetrated
and 1 if the system was successfully "shielded" or protected. Simulate the score "trajectories" for all systems,
assuming, for simplicity, a constant penetration probability p at each attack.

## Part b <br>
Same as before, but simulate the cumulated frequency, say f, of penetration. Do the same with the relative
frequency f/number of attacks and the "normalized" ratio: f/ âˆšnumber of attacks.


For any of the above 4 charts (which will be actually an instance of a unique "object", from a coder's point of view), plot
a vertical histogram at some point x (day or attack number, user parameter) and at the last abscissa
value.

# Implementation a-b
First of all we need a function to generate an array of values that simulates the un/successfull breaches each day for N days in each sistem.
The probability for the attack to be successfull is chosen by the user through the gui and each value is generated through this function.

```c#
insert code
```



## Bonus <br>

### Optional Part c

Given M computer systems. For each system, consider N days, where an attack can happen with probability p.
[You can allow p to change over systems or over days, if you wish, and note if there are differences in the (asymptotic) distribution.]
Chart the cumulative number of attacks at each day (all systems) or for each system (all days) with an animation
that shows, at any time, either the total number of attacks for each system or the attacks in each day for all systems.

### Optional Part d

Do the same as in the previous part but, instead of counting the days with attacks, count the actual attacks each day which
we assume to be (0, 1, ..., k) with respective (constant wrt time) probabilities (p0, ..., pk).

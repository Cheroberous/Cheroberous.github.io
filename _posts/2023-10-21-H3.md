# Statistic (practical assignment)

## Part a <br>
M systems are subject to a series of N attacks. On the x-axis, we indicate the attacks and on the Y-axis we
simulate the accumulation of a "security score" (-1, 1), where the score is -1 if the system is penetrated
and 1 if the system was successfully "shielded" or protected. Simulate the score "trajectories" for all systems,
assuming, for simplicity, a constant penetration probability p at each attack.

## Part b <br>
Same as before, but simulate the cumulated frequency, say f, of penetration. Do the same with the relative
frequency f/number of attacks and the "normalized" ratio: f/ √number of attacks.


For any of the above 4 charts (which will be actually an instance of a unique "object", from a coder's point of view), plot
a vertical histogram at some point x (day or attack number, user parameter) and at the last abscissa
value.

# Implementation a-b
First of all we need a function to generate an array of values that simulates the un/successfull breaches each day for N days in each sistem.
The probability for the attack to be successfull is chosen by the user through the gui and each value is generated through this function.

```c#
for (int i = 0; i < linee; i++)
{
    List<int> a = new List<int>();

    for (int j = 0; j < sample; j++)
    {

        float randomFloat = (float)rand.NextDouble();
        //Console.WriteLine($"valore usci vs prob == {randomFloat} {prob}");
        if (randomFloat < prob)                              
        {
            a.Add(+1);

        }
        else
        {
            a.Add(-1);
        }
    }
    listOfLists.Add(a);
}
```
## Point computation
For each system, for each "day" (sample) we compute the respective point in the line chart. The y will go up or down if the value is 1 or -1. 
```c#
 for (int j = 0; j < listOfLists.Count; j++)
 {

     PointF p0 = new PointF(r1.r.Left, ((r1.r.Bottom - r1.r.Top) / 2) + r1.r.Top);   // centro

     PointF next;

     for (int i = 0; i < listOfLists[j].Count; i++)                
     {

         float p1x = (float)p0.X + lunghezza_tratto;
         float p1y = (float)p0.Y + altezza_tratto;
         float p1y_m = (float)p0.Y - altezza_tratto;


         if (listOfLists[j][i] > 0)
         {

             next = new PointF(p1x, p1y);

             g.DrawLine(new_p, p0, next);           // if the value is 1
             p0 = next;
         }
         else
         {
             next = new PointF(p1x, p1y_m);
             g.DrawLine(new_p, p0, next);       // if the value is -1
             p0 = next;
         }

          ..................
```
## Keep it proportionated
We want to strech the chart, increment sample and system values but we want all contained in the rectangle in the bitmap.
The quantities " float p1y = (float)p0.Y +/- altezza_tratto;" and " float p1x = (float)p0.X + lunghezza_tratto;" (compute the y and the x of the next point) depends on the "lunghezza/altezza_tratto" that consider the position of the rectangle, the sample number ecc to keep the drawing proportionated and consistent
```c#
 lunghezza_tratto = (r1.r.Right - r1.r.Left) / sample;
 altezza_tratto = (r1.r.Bottom - r1.r.Top) / sample;
```
## intervals Computation
Given the number of systems (linee) a value delta will be used to choose the number oF intervals and given the max and min value in the "somme" array we will have the width of them. "Somme" is a list of int that contains the sum of successfull attacks for each system.
```c#
delta = 5;
int m = somme.Max();  
int min = somme.Min();
int q_n = linee / delta;
int q = (somme.Max() - somme.Min()) / q_n;
int intervalli = somme.Count / delta;
```

## Instogram drawing
From the line chart we receive the list of max successfull attacks from each system "val", the number of intervals and the width of them.
we need to calculate how many values fall in each intervals and draw a proportionated rectangle.

```c#
x_s = (int)(r1.r.Left + (sample) * lunghezza_tratto);     
int y_s = r1.r.Bottom;
int y_f = r1.r.Top;
int base_rett = (y_s - y_f) / linee;


for (int j = 0; j < inter; j++)
{
    int quanti_ne_cadono = 0;

    for (int i = 0; i < val.Count; i++)
    {
        int min = val.Min() + (spaziatura * j);
        int m = val.Min() + (spaziatura * (j + 1));
        if (val[i] > min && val[i] < m)                // check the interval of the value
        {
            quanti_ne_cadono++;     // quanti di successo
        }
    }


    //grafica
    int l = (int)(quanti_ne_cadono * lunghezza_tratto);
    if (l >= 0)
    {
        r_insto = new Rectangle(x_s, y_s - (base_rett) * (j + 1), l, base_rett);          // DRAW

        // compute the position of each rectangle (for the istogram)

        g.DrawRectangle(Pens.Black, r_insto);
        g.FillRectangle(Brushes.Red, r_insto);



    }
```

## Considerations
Is what you see what you expected? What about the averages of the distributions and the shapes of the histograms:
do you see regularities, differences and can you attempt to explain what you see or guessing what are
the "theoretical" limit distribution, when as N increases, and you can make the distribution simulation "more detailed" by increasing M ?

As shown by the previous image, higher the number of sample and systems we will see an istogram that looks like a bell curve.
Although with a low number of samples and S an irregular shape will be displayed:

![grafico](/assets/statiistics/h3/js_low.png)

The theoretical limit distribution of security scores as N (systems) and M (samples) increases could be approximated using probability theory, knowing the relation between probability p and outcomes of attack.
Depending on the characteristics (high N and M) of the simulation, we expect a limiting distribution that approaches a normal distribution.

(The latter images come from the js version of the program)


# Bonus (Implementation C-D) <br>

### Optional Part c

Given M computer systems. For each system, consider N days, where an attack can happen with probability p.
[You can allow p to change over systems or over days, if you wish, and note if there are differences in the (asymptotic) distribution.]
Chart the cumulative number of attacks at each day (all systems) or for each system (all days) ...

We already have the function to chart the samples and compute the instogram (slightly modified), the only thing to change is how the sample set is generated.

```c#
 for (int i = 0; i < linee; i++)
 {
     List<int> a = new List<int>();

     for (int j = 0; j < sample; j++)      
     {

         randomProb = rand.NextDouble();                        // day prob
         randomFloat = rand.NextDouble();                       // limit day prob
         //Console.WriteLine($"valore usci vs prob == {randomFloat} {prob}");
         if (randomFloat < randomProb)
         {
             a.Add(+1);

         }
         else
         {
          .............
 }
```
Now p change over system each day, the resulting istogram looks like this: 

![grafico](/assets/statiistics/h3/optional_c.png)

Looks like no prevision can be done on the shape 





### Optional Part d

Do the same as in the previous part but, instead of counting the days with attacks, count the actual attacks each day which
we assume to be (0, 1, ..., k) with respective (constant wrt time) probabilities (p0, ..., pk). <br>

With random probability and considering k days with i={0,...,k} respective attacks, the line chart spike after a short time (maybe some coding problem(?)) but again
the instogram shows irregularuty in the number of successfull attacks.

# Exercise 2

Recall briefly the definition and math notions relevant to "probability space" and make some simple examples, indicating among the triple of the space the meaning of each element in your particular example.
If you wanted to model probabilistically the homework Exercise 1, explain what are the 3 sets of your probability space and their elements, in this case.

A probability space is a triple (Ω ,F,P) , where Omega is a sample space, F is a sigma-algebra of events and p is a probability measure on F.

### Elements of a probability space
The three building blocks of a probability space can be described as follows:
1. the sample space Omega is the set of all possible outcomes of a probabilistic experiment;
1. the sigma-algebra F is the collection of all subsets of Omega to which we are able/willing to assign probabilities; these subsets are called events;
1. the probability measure P is a function that associates a probability to each of the events belonging to the sigma-algebra F.

### Examples (metti immagini)

1. Coin Toss:
Sample Space: Ω = {Heads (H), Tails (T)}
Event Space: F = {∅, {H}, {T}, {H, T}}
Probability Measure: P(H) = 0.5, P(T) = 0.5

1. Deck of Cards:
Sample Space: Ω = 52 distinct playing cards
Event Space: F could include various events like "drawing a red card," "drawing a spade," or "drawing a face card."
Probability Measure: P(drawing a red card) = 26/52 = 0.5

1. Rolling Two Dice:
Sample Space: Ω = {(1,1), (1,2), ..., (6,6)} (36 possible outcomes)
Event Space: F could include events like "sum of the two dice is 7" or "at least one die is a 5."
Probability Measure: P(sum of the two dice is 7) = 6/36 = 1/6

## Building blocks of probability of space

Sample space
The first one, the sample space Omega, is a primitive concept, loosely defined as the set of all possible outcomes of the probabilistic experiment.
The other two building blocks are instead defined rigorously, by enumerating the properties (or axioms) that they need to satisfy

Event Space (F)
The event space, denoted as F, is a collection of subsets of the sample space. Each subset represents a specific event or set of outcomes.
Example: In the case of a die roll, F could include events like "rolling an even number" (F = {2, 4, 6}) or "rolling a number less than 3" (F = {1, 2}).

Probability Measure (P):
The probability measure, denoted as P, assigns a probability value to each event in the event space. It quantifies the likelihood of an event occurring.
Example: For a fair six-sided die, P(rolling a 1) = 1/6, and P(rolling an even number) = 3/6 = 1/2.

A probability space must satisfy two essential properties:

The probability of the entire sample space Ω is equal to 1: P(Ω) = 1.
The probability of the union of disjoint events is the sum of their individual probabilities: P(A ∪ B) = P(A) + P(B) for disjoint events A and B.

In our first exercise
the set of all possible outcomes are contained in the maximum and minimum higth reached by the lowest and the hiest line representing a specific sistem, we reach the hiest numer if each day we have a breach.

the event space can be every subset of reached values

the probability is the one chosen by the user wich assugn probability p to the breach to happen and 1-p to the opposite

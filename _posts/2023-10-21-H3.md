# Statistic (practical assignment)
## 1
Choose 3 variables from our surveys:
1. one Qualitative
1. one Quantitative discrete
1. one Quantitative continuous 

create the most efficient algorithms to compute the frequency (absolute/relative/percentage) distribution of:

1. the 3 variables
1. the joint distribution of 2 variables (use a general "logic", where variables could be any number, k=2.3,...).

## (please note that the following programs work with the file "dat1.csv" provided with the source code that has been cleared and exported with semicolon as variables separator)
# C# implementation
After requesting the file, the different lines are split ";" and the variable is extracted and trimmed

```c#
string[] fields = line.Split(';');

// Extract values

string value = fields[cosa].Trim().ToLower();
string[] t = value.Split(',');
```

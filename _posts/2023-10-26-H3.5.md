# Practical part 

Revise and optimize you previous programs to compute the joint distribution of any number of 2,3, ...k, continuous quantitative variables
where, for each variable, the user can specify the number of subdivisions ("class intervals") of a range containing the observed values.

Revise also your previous homework taking into account that qualitative variables can be ordered and therefore the order needs to be preserved.

For quantitative variables, include the possibility to specify class intervals too.


## Optional
Create a some visual representation of the distribution. Use creatively your fantasy and skills (you may invent new representations, if you like).


# Theory 

Research

(Revise and improve your simulations in homework 3, where necessary.)
Search on the web about the Law of large numbers LLN and compare it with Part b of your homework 3 and express in your own words whether your simulation is somehow related with this theorem, and why.
Search on the web about the Central Limit Theorem CLT and compare it with Part a of your homework 3 and say in your own words whether your simulation is somehow related with this theorem, and why.
Based on the CLT, how could you modify ("normalize") the "security score" to obtain an asymptotic convergence to a proper distribution?

## LLN 

A Law of Large Numbers (LLN) is a proposition that provides a set of sufficient conditions for the convergence of the sample mean to a constant.

Let {Xn} be a sequence of random variables.

Let Xn be the sample mean of the first n terms of the sequence:

$$
  \overline{X_n} =  \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n X_i  
$$
A Law of Large Numbers (LLN) states some conditions that are sufficient to guarantee the convergence of Xn to a constant, as the sample size n increases.

Typically, the constant is the expected value of the distribution from which the sample has been drawn:

_demo_

Typically, all the random variables in the sequence { $X_n$ } have the same expected value  $E\left[ X_n \right] = \mu$ . In this case, the constant to which the sample mean converges is mu (which is called population mean).

## COMPARE WITH PART B

The part B of the previous homework asked to "simulate the cumulated frequency, say f, of penetration. Do the same with the relative..." , there the probability of fail/success was fixed and chosen by the user so the shape that will appear is not related to the LLN (infact the result is not a uniform distributon) but will be a bell curve.

## CLT

The Central Limit Theorem (CLT) is a statistical concept that states that the sample mean distribution of a random variable will assume a near-normal or normal distribution if the sample size is large enough. In simple terms, the theorem states that the sampling distribution of the mean approaches a normal distribution as the size of the sample increases, regardless of the shape of the original population distribution. <br>

_demo_

As the user increases the number of samples to 30, 40, 50, etc., the graph of the sample means will move towards a normal distribution. The sample size must be 30 or higher for the central limit theorem to hold.

One of the most important components of the theorem is that the **mean of the sample will be the mean of the entire population**. If you calculate the mean of multiple samples of the population, add them up, and find their average, the result will be the estimate of the population mean.

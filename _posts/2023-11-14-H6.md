# Exercise

## All the code can be found in this [repo](https://github.com/Cheroberous/Statistic/tree/main/H5/)

# Research

In the previous section, we implemented the simplest kind of symmetric random walk,
one can imagine the random walk as representing a sequence of tosses of a weighted coin, with a head appearing with probability  p
and a tail appearing with probability q or an alternative formulation of this situation is that of a **gambler** playing a sequence of games against an adversary where, in each game, the gambler has probability p (50% in our case) of winning.

### The Gambler’s Ruin Problem
The above formulation of this type of random walk leads to a problem known as the **Gambler’s Ruin problem**.
A gambler starts with a “stake" of size s (0 in our case), she/he plays until the capital reaches the value  M (security score)
or the value zero (in our sistem we record the penetration score reached).
We are interested in studying the probability of occurrence of each of these outcomes.
_In the exercise we can consider the first penetration score as bankrupt and the sequential penetration scores as indebt situation_
<br>

## More on our simulation
To be more specific our simulation and the different green/red color shows the probability that a sistem subject to N attacks with 
breach probability $$p=\frac{1}{2}$$ will reach the security score (capital gain x for the gambler) rathar than reach one of the P (penetration score) lines and be discarded. <br>
We can observe that more the security score line is far from the starting point more the sistem is likely to reach one of the threshold P before the former. 
We can also observe that (obviously) near-penetration score threshold are reached more (absolute value) than the distant ones.
## History 

In 1711, De **Moivre**, in his book , gave an ingenious derivation of the probability of ruin. The following description of his argument is taken from David.6 The notation used is as follows: We imagine that there are two players, A and B, and the probabilities that they win a game are  p and  q, respectively. The players start with  a and  b counters, respectively.

_"Imagine that each player starts with his counters before him in a pile, and that nominal values are assigned to the counters in the following manner. A’s bottom counter is given the nominal value  q/p
 ; the next is given the nominal value  (q/p)2
 , and so on until his top counter which has the nominal value  (q/p)a
 . B’s top counter is valued  (q/p)a+1
 , and so on downwards until his bottom counter which is valued  (q/p)a+b
 . After each game the loser’s top counter is transferred to the top of the winner’s pile, and it is always the top counter which is staked for the next game. Then B’s stake is always  q/p times A’s, so that at every game each player’s nominal expectation is nil. This remains true throughout the play; therefore A’s chance of winning all B’s counters, multiplied by his nominal gain if he does so, must equal B’s chance multiplied by B’s nominal gain. Thus,"_

$$
P_a((\frac{q}{p})^{a+1}+⋯+(\frac{q}{p})^{a+b})=Pb((\frac{q}{p})+⋯+(\frac{q}{p})^a) .
$$

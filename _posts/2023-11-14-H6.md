# Exercise

# Research

In the last section, the simplest kind of symmetric random walk in the **Exercise** was studied,
One can imagine the random walk as representing a sequence of tosses of a weighted coin, with a head appearing with probability  p
and a tail appearing with probability  q. An alternative formulation of this situation is that of a gambler playing a sequence of games against an adversary (sometimes thought of as another person, sometimes called “the house") where, in each game, the gambler has probability  p
of winning.

### The Gambler’s Ruin Problem
The above formulation of this type of random walk leads to a problem known as the Gambler’s Ruin problem.
A gambler starts with a “stake" of size s (0 in out case) . She/he plays until the capital reaches the value  M (security score)
or the value (in our sistem we record the penetrationscore reached).
We are interested in studying the probability of occurrence of each of these outcomes.
nel nostro caso la soglia 0 o è uno dei p o possiamo considerare il p rimo come denaro=0 e gli altri come negativo

# Exercise
Consider a scheme similar to Homework 3, Part a
where M systems are subject to a series of N attacks. A system is discarded as "unsecure" if it reaches a penetration score of P before reaching, instead, a security score of S. Simulate and represent the probabilities of a system being discarded, for various values of P, example: P = k*10 (k=2,...,10), conditional on the 3 cases for S: S = 20, S = 60, S = 100.


### Small upgrades
The code from the previous homework that draws the chart and the instogram was slitly modified and several changes were made to the overall structures here's some:

+ The high of the "jump" made by a point in the linechart when an attach is successfull is determined by the highest value (penetrated attacks) reached by a system in the symulation.
This will provide more stability over different N and M.
Also the length has been modified to make space for the instogram inside the rectangle.
```c#
  altezza_tratto = (float)(((float)(quale_r.r.Bottom - quale_r.r.Top) / 2) / (float)(max_y));       
  lunghezza_tratto = (float)((quale_r.r.Right - quale_r.r.Left)*80/100) / sample;
```



+ Most of the computation was traslated when the different sistems are generated (as list of +1/-1) including the computation of the intervals for the instogram so the prossess will be more 
fluid and avoid unnecessary calculations.

+ The new method to calculate the maximum value reached to scale the drawing (altezza_tratto) now take into account also the negative values:
```c#
 for (int i = 0; i < som_lol.Count; i++)                          
 {       
     int num = Math.Abs(som_lol[i]);
     if (num > max_y)
     {
         max_y = num;
     }  
 }
```

## New classe
We are intested on knowing if a sistem reached a security score and in that case which of them but also "how much" it was breached by the N attacks and the
**penetration score**. To do that i have add a new class that keep track of this for each system:

```c#
class sistema
{
    public int num_linea;

    public int soglia1=0;
    public int soglia2=0;
    public int soglia3=0;

    public int p_score1=0;
    public int p_score2=0;
    public int p_score3=0;
}

```
To avoid using and array for each penetration scores (9) reached (based on security score) i used a variable that is incremented when the specific system reach a threshold and is NOT decremented 
if it will go lower that (so it register the highest penetration score reached BEFORE  touching the interested **security score**).
More details in the code below:

```c#
....

if (som_lol[i] <= -20 && sistema.soglia1 != 1)
{
    sistema.soglia1 = 1;
}
if (sistema.soglia1 != 1)
{
    for (int k = 0; k < inter_p.Count; k++)
    {
        var t = inter_p[k];
        if (som_lol[i] > t.Item1 && som_lol[i] < t.Item2)
        {
            if (sistema.p_score1 < k + 1)              // update only if the trashold is greater that the previous one
            {
                sistema.p_score1 = k + 1;
            }
        }
    }
}   .......

```
The variable **som_lol[i]** keep track of the current "position" of the sistem **i** on the chart and check (if the security score is not already been reached) if a penetration score trashold has been hit.
<br>
Once all the sistems object are filled i can compute the heigth of the rectangles in the instogram and store them in an array
```c#

foreach (sistema s in lista_sistemi)
{
    for (int i = s.p_score1; i > 0; i--)
    {   
        fin[i - 1]++;
    }
    for (int i = s.p_score2; i > 0; i--)
    {
   
        fin2[i - 1]++;
    }
    for (int i = s.p_score3; i > 0; i--)
    {
        fin3[i - 1]++;
    }

}

```
All set, let's see the output:

# Research

In the previous section, we implemented the simplest kind of symmetric random walk,
one can imagine the random walk as representing a sequence of tosses of a weighted coin, with a head appearing with probability  p
and a tail appearing with probability q or an alternative formulation of this situation is that of a **gambler** playing a sequence of games against an adversary where, in each game, the gambler has probability p (50% in our case) of winning.

_simple random walk_

### The Gambler’s Ruin Problem
The above formulation of this type of random walk leads to a problem known as the **Gambler’s Ruin problem**.
A gambler starts with a “stake" of size s (0 in our case), she/he plays until the capital reaches the value  M (security score)
or the value zero (in our sistem we record the penetration score reached).
We are interested in studying the probability of occurrence of each of these outcomes.
_In the exercise we can consider the first penetration score as bankrupt and the sequential penetration scores as indebt situation_
<br>

## More on our simulation
To be more specific our simulation and the different green/red color shows the probability that a sistem subject to N attacks with 
breach probability $$p=\frac{1}{2}$$ will reach the security score (capital gain x for the gambler) rathar than reach one of the P (penetration score) lines and be discarded. <br>
We can observe that more the security score line is far from the starting point more the sistem is likely to reach one of the threshold P before the former. 
We can also observe that (obviously) near-penetration score threshold are reached more (absolute value) than the distant ones.
## History 

In 1711, De **Moivre**, in his book , gave an ingenious derivation of the probability of ruin. The following description of his argument is taken from David.6 The notation used is as follows: We imagine that there are two players, A and B, and the probabilities that they win a game are  p and  q, respectively. The players start with  a and  b counters, respectively.

_"Imagine that each player starts with his counters before him in a pile, and that nominal values are assigned to the counters in the following manner. A’s bottom counter is given the nominal value  q/p
 ; the next is given the nominal value  (q/p)2
 , and so on until his top counter which has the nominal value  (q/p)a
 . B’s top counter is valued  (q/p)a+1
 , and so on downwards until his bottom counter which is valued  (q/p)a+b
 . After each game the loser’s top counter is transferred to the top of the winner’s pile, and it is always the top counter which is staked for the next game. Then B’s stake is always  q/p times A’s, so that at every game each player’s nominal expectation is nil. This remains true throughout the play; therefore A’s chance of winning all B’s counters, multiplied by his nominal gain if he does so, must equal B’s chance multiplied by B’s nominal gain. Thus,"_

$$
P_a((\frac{q}{p})^{a+1}+⋯+(\frac{q}{p})^{a+b})=Pb((\frac{q}{p})+⋯+(\frac{q}{p})^a) .
$$

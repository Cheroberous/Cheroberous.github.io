# Stochastic processes and SDE's

## Stochastic processes
In probability theory and related fields, a stochastic or random process is a mathematical object usually defined as a sequence of random variables, where the index of the sequence has the interpretation of time. Stochastic processes are widely used as mathematical models of systems and phenomena that appear to vary in a random manner. Examples include the growth of a bacterial population, an electrical current fluctuating due to thermal noise, or the movement of a gas molecule. <br>

Applications and the study of phenomena have in turn inspired the proposal of new stochastic processes. Examples of such stochastic processes include the Wiener process or Brownian motion process, used by Louis Bachelier to study price changes on the Paris Bourse, and the Poisson process, used by A. K. Erlang to study the number of phone calls occurring in a certain period of time. These two stochastic processes are considered the most important and central in the theory of stochastic processes, and were discovered repeatedly and independently, both before and after Bachelier and Erlang, in different settings and countries.

### Introduction
A stochastic or random process can be defined as a collection of random variables that is indexed by some mathematical set, meaning that each random variable of the stochastic process is uniquely associated with an element in the set. The set used to index the random variables is called the index set. <br>

Each random variable in the collection takes values from the same mathematical space known as the state space. This state space can be, for example, the integers, the real line or 
n-dimensional Euclidean space. An increment is the amount that a stochastic process changes between two index values, often interpreted as two points in time.
A stochastic process can have many outcomes, due to its randomness, and a single outcome of a stochastic process is called, among other names, a sample function or realization. <br>

## SDEs
Stochastic differential equations (SDEs) appear today as a modeling tool in several sciences as telecommunications, economics, finance, biology, and quantum field theory.
An SDE is essentially a classical differential equation which is perturbed by a random noise. When nothing else is specified, SDE means in fact ordinary SDE; in that case it corresponds to the perturbation of an ordinary differential equation. Stochastic partial differential equations (SPDEs) are obtained as random perturbation of partial differential equations (PDEs).
One of the most important difference between deterministic and stochastic ordinary differential equations is described by the so-called Peano type phenomenon.
A classical differential equation with continuous and linear growth coefficients admits global existence but not uniqueness as classical calculus text books illustrate studying equations of the type: <br>

However, if one perturbs the right member of the equality with an additive Gaussian white noise (ξt) (even with very small intensity), then the problem becomes well stated. A similar phenomenon happens with linear PDEs of evolution type perturbed with a spacetime white noise. <br>
SDEs constitute a vast subject and account for an incredible amount of relevant contributions. <br>

A SDE is comprised of a differential equation that includes a stochastic process, the simplest example being Brownian motion. Geometrical Brownian motion is often used to describe stock market prices. This SDE may be written, $ \mathrm{d}P(t)=P(t)\mu \mathrm{d}+P(t)\theta\mathrm{d}W(t) $, where P(t) is the price at time t and the parameters μ > 0 and σ > 0 are the drift and diffusion parameters. The Gaussian white noise term, W(t), may be considered the derivative of Brownian motion. This SDE may also be written, $\mathrm{d}log(P(t))=\mu \mathrm{d}t + \theta\mathrm{d}W(t) $, so we see that P(t) > 0 and log(P(t)) is Brownian motion. <br>

More complicated SDE's may involve more complex drift and volatility functions. The book (Iacus, 2008) provides an intuitive and informal introduction to SDE and could be used in an introductory course on SDE. Only SDE's with Gaussian white noise are considered. The accompanying R package (Iacus, 2009) provides R scripts for all figures in the book (Iacus, 2008) as well as functions for simulation and statistical inference with SDE.

An important area of application is in financial mathematics, where option values or risk assessments are often driven by SDE systems. <br>


Usually, Monte-Carlo simulation is the only way to find approximate solutions. The main class of SDE considered by this package is a diffusion process of the following form, <br>

with some initial condition X(0), where W(t) is a standard Brownian motion. <br>

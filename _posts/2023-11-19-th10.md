# The Wiener process and the GBM, Derivations and simulations

One of the most important stochastic processes is the Wiener process or Brownian (motion) process,
The Wiener process can be considered a continuous version of the simple random walk. This continuous-time stochastic process is a highly studied and used object. It plays a key role different probability fields, particularly those focused on stochastic processes such as  stochastic calculus and the theories of Markov processes, martingales, Gaussian processes, and Levy processes.

The Wiener process is named after Norbert Wiener, but it is called the Brownian motion process or often just Brownian motion due to its historical connection as a model for Brownian movement in liquids, a physical phenomenon observed by Robert Brown. But the physical process is not true a Wiener process, which can be treated as an idealized model.

# Winer process

## Definition
Definition: Standard Wiener or Brownian (motion) process

A real-valued stochastic process {Wt:t≥0} defined on a probability space (Ω,A,P) is a standard Wiener (or Brownian motion) process if it has the following properties:

+ The initial value of the stochastic process {Wt:t≥0} is zero with probability one, meaning P(W0=0)=1.
+ The increment Wt−Ws is independent of the past, that is, Wu, where 0≤u≤s.
+ The increment Wt−Ws is a normal variable with mean o and variance t−s.

In some literature, the initial value of the stochastic process may not be given. Alternatively, it is simply stated as W0=0 instead of the more precise (probabilistic) statement given above.

Properties
The definition of the Wiener process means that it has stationary and independent increments. These are arguably the most important properties as they lead to the great tractability of this stochastic process. The increments are normal random variables, implying they can have both positive and negative (real) values.

+ The Wiener process exhibits closure properties, meaning you apply certain operations, you get another Wiener process. For example, if W={Wt:t≥0} is a Wiener process, then for a scaling constant c>0, the resulting stochastic process {Wct/c√:t≥0}is also a Wiener process. Such properties are useful for proving mathematical results.

+ Properties such as independence and stationarity of the increments are so-called distributional properties. But the sample paths of this stochastic process are also interesting. A sample path of a Wiener process is continuous almost everywhere.

 + The standard Wiener process process has the Markov property, making it an example of a Markov process.  The standard Wiener process W={Wt}t≥0 is a martingale. Interestingly, the stochastic process  $latex W=\{ W_t^2-t\}_{t\geq 0} is also a martingale. The Wiener process is a fundamental object in martingale theory. <br>

## Simulating
The defining properties of the Wiener process, namely independence and stationarity of increments, results in it being easy to simulate. The Wiener can be simulated provided random variables can be simulated or sampled according to a normal distribution. The main challenge is that the Wiener process is a continuous-time stochastic process, but computer simulations run in a discrete universe. <br>

_A single realization of a two-dimensional Wiener (or Brownian motion) process. Each vector component is an independent standard Wiener process._

# GBM

A geometric Brownian motion (GBM) (also known as exponential Brownian motion) is a continuous-time stochastic process in which the logarithm of the randomly varying quantity follows a Brownian motion (also called a Wiener process) with drift. It is an important example of stochastic processes satisfying a stochastic differential equation (SDE); in particular, it is used in mathematical finance to model stock prices in the Black–Scholes model. <br>

A stochastic process St is said to follow a GBM if it satisfies the following stochastic differential equation (SDE):

$dS_{t}=\mu S_{t}\,dt+\sigma S_{t}\,dW_{t}$
where $W_{t}$ is a Wiener process or Brownian motion, and 
$\mu$  ('the percentage drift') and 
$\sigma$  ('the percentage volatility') are constants.

The former parameter is used to model deterministic trends, while the latter parameter models unpredictable events occurring during the motion. <br>

Simulating sample paths: <br>
```python
# Python code for the plot

import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

mu = 1
n = 50
dt = 0.1
x0 = 100
np.random.seed(1)

sigma = np.arange(0.8, 2, 0.2)

x = np.exp(
    (mu - sigma ** 2 / 2) * dt
    + sigma * np.random.normal(0, np.sqrt(dt), size=(len(sigma), n)).T
)
x = np.vstack([np.ones(len(sigma)), x])
x = x0 * x.cumprod(axis=0)

plt.plot(x)
plt.legend(np.round(sigma, 2))
plt.xlabel("$t$")
plt.ylabel("$x$")
plt.title(
    "Realizations of Geometric Brownian Motion with different variances\n $\mu=1$"
)
plt.show()

```

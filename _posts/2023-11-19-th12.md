# Ito Integration and Calculus, Concept and Didactical Simulations
Itô calculus, named after Kiyosi Itô, extends the methods of calculus to stochastic processes such as Brownian motion (see Wiener process). It has important applications in mathematical finance and stochastic differential equations.

The central concept is the Itô stochastic integral, a stochastic generalization of the Riemann–Stieltjes integral in analysis. The integrands and the integrators are now stochastic processes: <br>
$ Y_t=\int _{0}^{t} H_s dX_s $  <br>
where H is a locally square-integrable process adapted to the filtration generated by X (Revuz & Yor 1999, Chapter IV), which is a Brownian motion or, more generally, a semimartingale. The result of the integration is then another stochastic process. Concretely, the integral from 0 to any particular t is a random variable, defined as a limit of a certain sequence of random variables. The paths of Brownian motion fail to satisfy the requirements to be able to apply the standard techniques of calculus. So with the integrand a stochastic process, the Itô stochastic integral amounts to an integral with respect to a function which is not differentiable at any point and has infinite variation over every time interval. The main insight is that the integral can be defined as long as the integrand H is adapted, which loosely speaking means that its value at time t can only depend on information available up until this time. Roughly speaking, one chooses a sequence of partitions of the interval from 0 to t and constructs Riemann sums. Every time we are computing a Riemann sum, we are using a particular instantiation of the integrator. It is crucial which point in each of the small intervals is used to compute the value of the function. The limit then is taken in probability as the mesh of the partition is going to zero. Numerous technical details have to be taken care of to show that this limit exists and is independent of the particular sequence of partitions. Typically, the left end of the interval is used.

## Results and uses
Important results of Itô calculus include the integration by parts formula and Itô's lemma, which is a change of variables formula. These differ from the formulas of standard calculus, due to quadratic variation terms.

In mathematical finance, the described evaluation strategy of the integral is conceptualized as that we are first deciding what to do, then observing the change in the prices. The integrand is how much stock we hold, the integrator represents the movement of the prices, and the integral is how much money we have in total including what our stock is worth, at any given moment. The prices of stocks and other traded financial assets can be modeled by stochastic processes such as Brownian motion or, more often, geometric Brownian motion (see Black–Scholes). Then, the Itô stochastic integral represents the payoff of a continuous-time trading strategy consisting of holding an amount Ht of the stock at time t. In this situation, the condition that H is adapted corresponds to the necessary restriction that the trading strategy can only make use of the available information at any time. This prevents the possibility of unlimited gains through clairvoyance: buying the stock just before each uptick in the market and selling before each downtick. <br>

## Properties

The following properties can be found in works such as (Revuz & Yor 1999) and (Rogers & Williams 2000): <br>

+ The stochastic integral is a càdlàg process. Furthermore, it is a semimartingale.
+ The discontinuities of the stochastic integral are given by the jumps of the integrator multiplied by the integrand. The jump of a càdlàg process at a time t is Xt − Xt−, and is often denoted by ΔXt. With this notation, Δ(H · X) = H ΔX. A particular consequence of this is that integrals with respect to a continuous process are always themselves continuous.
+ Associativity. Let J, K be predictable processes, and K be X-integrable. Then, J is K · X integrable if and only if JK is X integrable, in which case$ J\cdot (K\cdot X)=(JK)\cdot X $
+ Dominated convergence. Suppose that Hn → H and |Hn| ≤ J, where J is an X-integrable process. then Hn · X → H · X. Convergence is in probability at each time t. In fact, it converges uniformly on compact sets in probability.
+ The stochastic integral commutes with the operation of taking quadratic covariations. If X and Y are semimartingales then any X-integrable process will also be [X, Y]-integrable, and [H · X, Y] = H · [X, Y]. A consequence of this is that the quadratic variation process of a stochastic integral is equal to an integral of a quadratic variation process, [H\cdot X]=H^{2}\cdot [X]

# "Online" Algorithms (Data Streams): Ideas and code

## Data Streams 
Efficiently handling vast datasets has become increasingly crucial in recent decades, driven by the widespread availability of substantial data volumes across various computational science applications. A significant data management challenge has arisen, particularly in monitoring extensive and rapidly changing data streams that continuously emerge. This issue is prominent in diverse applications, including the analysis of network traffic, online auctions, transaction logs, telephone call records, automated bank machine operations, as well as atmospheric and astronomical events. Consequently, the streaming model has garnered considerable attention. This model distinguishes itself from traditional computation over stored datasets, as algorithms are required to process input through either a single pass or a limited number of passes, utilizing a constrained amount of working memory. The streaming model is applicable in scenarios where the input size far surpasses the available main memory, and the practical means of accessing the data involves making one or more passes over it. <br>

## Applications 
The primary application of data stream algorithms is to monitorcontinuously huge and rapidly changing streams of data in order to support exploratory
analyses and to detect correlations, rare events, fraud, intrusion, and unusual or anomalous activities (as in **IDS** and **IPS**). Such streams of data may be, for example, performance measurements in traffic management, all detail records in telecommunications, transactions in retail chains, ATM operations in banks, bids in online auctions (Ordering in an asynchronous network is an interesting problem thet requires ad-hoc algorithms), log records generated by Web Servers, or sensor network data. In all these cases, the volumes of data are huge (several terabytes or even petabytes), and records arrive at a rapid rate. Other relevant applications for data stream processing are related, for example, to processing massive files on secondary storage and to monitoring the contents of large databases or data warehouse environments.

###  Network Management 
Perhaps the most prominent application is related to network management. This involves monitoring and configuring network
hardware and software to ensure smooth operations. Consider, for example, traffic
analysis in the Internet. Here, as IP packets flow through the routers, we would like
to monitor link bandwidth usage, to estimate traffic demands, to detect faults, congestion, and usage patterns. Typical queries that we would be able to answer are thus
the following. How many IP addresses used a given link in a certain period of time?
How many bytes were sent between a pair of IP addresses? Which are the top 100 IP
addresses in terms of traffic? What is the average duration of an IP session? Which
sessions transmitted more than 1000 bytes? Which IP addresses are involved in more
than 1000 sessions? All these queries are heavily motivated by traffic analysis, fraud
detection, and security.
To get a rough estimate of the amount of data that need to be analyzed to answer
one such query, consider that each router can forward up to 1 billion packets per hour,
and each Internet Service Provider may have many hundreds of routers: thus, many
terabytes of data per hour need to be processed.

### Online Auctions 
During the last few years, online implementations of
auctions have become a reality, thanks to the Internet and to the wide use of computermediated communication technologies. In an online auction system, people register
to the system, open auctions for individual items at any time, and then submit continuously items for auction and bids for items. Statistical estimation of auction data is
thus very important for identifying items of interest to vendors and purchasers, and
for analyzing economic trends.

# "Online" Algorithms (Data Streams): Ideas and code

## Data Streams 
Efficiently handling vast datasets has become increasingly crucial in recent decades, driven by the widespread availability of substantial data volumes across various computational science applications. A significant data management challenge has arisen, particularly in monitoring extensive and rapidly changing data streams that continuously emerge. This issue is prominent in diverse applications, including the analysis of network traffic, online auctions, transaction logs, telephone call records, automated bank machine operations, as well as atmospheric and astronomical events. Consequently, the streaming model has garnered considerable attention. This model distinguishes itself from traditional computation over stored datasets, as algorithms are required to process input through either a single pass or a limited number of passes, utilizing a constrained amount of working memory. The streaming model is applicable in scenarios where the input size far surpasses the available main memory, and the practical means of accessing the data involves making one or more passes over it. <br>

## Applications 
The primary application of data stream algorithms is to monitorcontinuously huge and rapidly changing streams of data in order to support exploratory
analyses and to detect correlations, rare events, fraud, intrusion, and unusual or anomalous activities (as in **IDS** and **IPS**). Such streams of data may be, for example, performance measurements in traffic management, all detail records in telecommunications, transactions in retail chains, ATM operations in banks, bids in online auctions (Ordering in an asynchronous network is an interesting problem thet requires ad-hoc algorithms), log records generated by Web Servers, or sensor network data. In all these cases, the volumes of data are huge (several terabytes or even petabytes), and records arrive at a rapid rate. Other relevant applications for data stream processing are related, for example, to processing massive files on secondary storage and to monitoring the contents of large databases or data warehouse environments.

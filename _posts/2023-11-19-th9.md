#  The Poisson Process: Meaning,Properties,Simulations

# What Is a Poisson Process?
A Poisson process is a model for a series of discrete events where the average time between events is known, but the exact timing of events is random. The arrival of an event is independent of the event before (waiting time between events is memoryless). For example, suppose we own a website that our content delivery network (CDN) tells us goes down on average once per 60 days, but one failure doesn’t affect the probability of the next. All we know is the average time between failures. The failures are a Poisson process that looks like: <br>

We know the average time between events, but the events are randomly spaced in time (stochastic). We might have back-to-back failures, but we could also go years between failures because the process is stochastic. <br>

A Poisson process meets the following **criteria** (in reality, many phenomena modeled as Poisson processes don’t precisely match these but can be approximated as such): <br>
+ Events are independent of each other. The occurrence of one event does not affect the probability another event will occur.
+ The average rate (events per time period) is constant.
+ Two events cannot occur at the same time.

### Common examples
Common examples of Poisson processes are customers calling a help center, visitors to a website, radioactive decay in atoms, photons arriving at a space telescope and movements in a stock price. Poisson processes are generally associated with time, but they don’t have to be. In the case of stock prices, we might know the average movements per day (events per time), but we could also have a Poisson process for the number of trees in an acre (events per area).

One example of a Poisson process we often see is bus arrivals (or trains). However, this isn’t a proper Poisson process because the arrivals aren’t independent of one another. Even for bus systems that run on time, a late arrival from one bus can impact the next bus’s arrival time.

## The Poisson distribution formula
The Poisson distribution formula, which helps determine the pmf, is as follows: <br>

Where: <br>
+ k is the number of events that occurred in a given time period or interval 
+ k! is the factorial of k
+ e is Euler’s number (≈ 2.71828)
+ λ is the expected number of events in the given time period or interval
+ P(k) is the probability that an event will occur k times

**As we change the rate parameter, λ, we change the probability of seeing different numbers of events in one interval**. The graph below is the probability mass function of the Poisson distribution and shows the probability (y-axis) of a number of events (x-axis) occurring in one interval with different rate parameters. <br>

The most likely number of events in one interval for each curve is the curve’s rate parameter. This makes sense because the rate parameter is the expected number of events in one interval.


# Properties

1. Stationary Increment Property:
+ In a Poisson process, the number of events in a given time interval is independent of the past and future.
+ This property is often referred to as the "memoryless" property, meaning the process has no memory of the past.
2. Independent Increments:
+ The number of events in disjoint time intervals is independent.
+ If you consider non-overlapping time intervals, the number of events in one interval does not affect the number of events in another.
3. Time Homogeneity:
+ The Poisson process is time-homogeneous, meaning the rate of events is constant over time.
+ The probability of a certain number of events occurring in a time interval depends only on the length of the interval and the average rate.
4. Counting Process:
+ The Poisson process can be represented as a counting process  {N(t),t≥0}, where  N(t) is the number of events that have occurred by time t.
+ N(0)=0 (no events have occurred at time 0).
5. Independent and Identically Distributed (i.i.d.) Intervals:
+ The time between consecutive events (inter-arrival times) in a Poisson process follows an exponential distribution.
+ The exponential distribution is memoryless, aligning with the stationarity property.
6. Poisson Distribution for Events:
+ The number of events in a fixed interval of time or space follows a Poisson distribution.
+ The Poisson distribution is characterized by a single parameter λ, which represents the average rate of events per unit of time or space.
7. Probability Mass Function (PMF) for Intervals:
+ The probability that exactly  k events occur in a fixed interval of length t is given by the Poisson probability mass function:
P(N(t)=k)= $ \frac{λt^k e^{-λt}}{k!} $
8. Sum of Poisson Processes:
+ The sum of independent Poisson processes with rates λ1,λ2,…,λn is also a Poisson process with a rate equal to the sum of the individual rates.
9. Conditional Independence:
+ Given the number of events in a certain interval, the occurrence of events in disjoint intervals is independent.


# Simultation
here are three ways to simulate a Poisson process. The first method assumes simulating interarrival jumps’ times by Exponential distribution. The second method is to simulate the number of jumps in the given time period by Poisson distribution, and then the time of jumps by Uniform random variables.

A simple script for the first method: <br>
```python
sim_pp1 <- function(t, rate) {

    path <- matrix(0, nrow = 1, ncol = 2)

    jumps_time <- rexp(1, rate)

    while(jumps_time[length(jumps_time)] < t) {

        jump <- matrix(c(jumps_time[length(jumps_time)], path[nrow(path), 2],
                         jumps_time[length(jumps_time)], path[nrow(path), 2]  + 1),
                       nrow = 2, ncol = 2, byrow = TRUE)

        path <- rbind(path, jump)

        jumps_time <- c(jumps_time,
                        jumps_time[length(jumps_time)] + rexp(1, rate))
    }

    path <- rbind(path,
                  c(t, path[nrow(path), 2]))

    list(path, jumps_time)
}
```
<br>
Validation: <br>

```python
library("ggplot2")
library("magrittr")

set.seed(1)

path1 <- sim_pp1(1000, 1)
mean(diff(path1[[2]])); var(diff(path1[[2]]))
# [1] 1.029312
# [1] 0.9722406

data.frame(it = diff(path1[[2]])) %>%
    ggplot() +
    geom_histogram(aes(it, y = ..density..)) +
    stat_function(fun = dexp) +
    theme_bw() +
    theme(text = element_text(size = 24))

**Compare also with other possible simulation schemes which have been proposed eg, Milstein, Runge-Kutta, Heun's, ...), pointing out possible differences.**

The first list provided (as we know) consists of stochastic processes and mathematical models (commonly used in finance particularly in the context of options pricing and interest rate modeling), as deeply investigated in th8:

a stochastic or random process is a mathematical object usually defined as a sequence of random variables, where the index of the sequence has the interpretation of time. Stochastic processes are widely used as mathematical models of systems and phenomena that appear to vary in a random manner. <br>
<br>
An SDE instead is essentially a classical differential equation which is perturbed by a random noise. When nothing else is specified, SDE means in fact ordinary SDE; in that case it corresponds to the perturbation of an ordinary differential equation. Stochastic partial differential equations (SPDEs) are obtained as random perturbation of partial differential equations (PDEs). <br>
<br>

## Approximating/Solving the SDEs
Milstein, Runge-Kutta, and Heun's methods are numerical schemes for solving stochastic differential equations (SDEs), which are often used to simulate the evolution of the underlying processes. 
### Euler's method
In mathematics and computational science, the Euler method (also called the forward Euler method) is a first-order numerical procedure for solving ordinary differential equations (ODEs) with a given initial value. It is the most basic explicit method for numerical integration of ordinary differential equations and is the simplest Runge–Kutta method. <br>
<br>
Euler’s method uses the simple formula: <br>

to construct the tangent at the point x and obtain the value of y(x+h), whose slope is, $\frac{dX}{dY}$ <br>

In Euler’s method, you can approximate the curve of the solution by the tangent in each interval (that is, by a sequence of short line segments), at steps of h.

In general, if you use small step size, the accuracy of approximation increases. General formula:<br>

### Runge-Kutta method
The Runge-Kutta method attempts to overcome the problem of the Euler's method, as far as the choice of a sufficiently small step size is concerned, to reach a reasonable accuracy in the problem resolution. <br>
On the other hand, the minus of the Runge-Kutta method is that we need to calculate the increments ki involved in the numerical algorithm, enlarging the utilized workspace, generating a loss in efficiency, especially when, like in the Optimal Control theory, more variables are involved.

### Heun's method
In mathematics and computational science, Heun's method may refer to the improved or modified Euler's method or a similar two-stage Runge–Kutta method, is a numerical procedure for solving ordinary differential equations (ODEs) with a given initial value. 
The procedure for calculating the numerical solution to the initial value problem:

y'(t) = f(t,y(t))  $$  y\left(t_0\right)=y_0 $$
by way of Heun's method, is to first calculate the intermediate value $ \overline{y}_{i+1} $ and then the final approximation $ y_{i+1} $ at the next integration point. <br>

Where h is the step size and $t_{i+1}=t_i+h$

### Milstein

The Milstein method is a numerical technique used to approximate solutions to stochastic differential equations (SDEs). It is an extension of the Euler method and is particularly useful for simulating stochastic processes with non-constant volatility.

# Optional (+1 grade):
Compare also with other possible simulation schemes which have been proposed eg, Milstein, Runge-Kutta, Heun's, ...), pointing out possible differences.

The list provided (as we know) consists of stochastic processes and mathematical models (commonly used in finance particularly in the context of options pricing and interest rate modeling), as deeply investigated in th8

a stochastic or random process is a mathematical object usually defined as a sequence of random variables, where the index of the sequence has the interpretation of time. Stochastic processes are widely used as mathematical models of systems and phenomena that appear to vary in a random manner. <br>

An SDE is essentially a classical differential equation which is perturbed by a random noise. When nothing else is specified, SDE means in fact ordinary SDE; in that case it corresponds to the perturbation of an ordinary differential equation. Stochastic partial differential equations (SPDEs) are obtained as random perturbation of partial differential equations (PDEs).

# Exercise

Consider a scheme similar to Homework 3

First of all realize that the general scheme that you used so far (random walk and also Poisson process, etc.), can, more in general,
be used for any stochastic differential equations SDE (see, for instance, Euler–Maruyama method https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler%E2%80%93Maruyama_method).

In other words, with minor additions to your program you can now generalize this tool to simulate almost any stochastic
differential equations of interest for many applications

Create a web only version where you allow the user to explore (selectable by user) any useful stochastic process.

Do a research on the web and include any SDE that you think its interesting. Some examples of popular processes:

Arithmetic Brownian
Geometric Brownian (Black–Scholes)
Ornstein–Uhlenbeck (mean-reverting)
Vasicek
Hull–White
Cox–Ingersoll–Ross
Black–Karasinski
Heston
Chen model
[... any other interesting ...]

## Implementation
Starting from the homework 3 i have kept the plot function and made some changes here and there as in the max calculation to reproportion the linechart:

```javascript
 if (this.#values[k][i] > this.#maxValue) {
   this.#maxValue = this.#values[k][i];
} else if (this.#values[k][i] < this.#minValue) {
  this.#minValue = this.#values[k][i];
} .....
```

The previous version breaks time to times in specific situations that were not handled.

The trajectories are pre-computed (as in the recent homeworks) to reduce the computational weight of the program,
after the array of arrays (of trajectories) is generated the different points will simply be red and drawn by the **draw()** function:
```javascript
simulate() {
        for (let k = 0; k < this.#numberOfTrajectories; k++) { 

            const points = Array(this.#n);
            points[0] = new Point(0, 0);

            for (let i = 1; i < this.#n; i++) {
                this.#values[k][i] = this.#YFunc(this.#values, k, i);
                points[i] = new Point(i, this.#values[k][i]);
    
                ..........
            }
            this.#coordinates.push(points);
```
The function is **on for all** distribution, the key is that points will be generated based on the selected **YFunc**. <br>
<br>

For each distribution a set of parameters is establish

```javascript
 const Abm = {
            mu: undefined,
            sigma: undefined
        };

        const Gbm = {
            mu: undefined,
            sigma: undefined
        };

        const Uhl = {
            theta: undefined,
            sigma: undefined,
            mu: undefined
        };

        const Vas = {
            a: undefined,
            theta: undefined,
            sigma: undefined
        };

```
Most of the distribution formula came from **your page**, 
 <https://www.datatime.eu/public/cybersecurity/jsTutorial/23_EulerMaruyama.html> the remaining were esxtracted from wikipedia-related pages. <br>
Also some random generation function needed were implemented such as:<br>
```javascript
function rnorm(mean, stdev) {
            var u1, u2, v1, v2, s;
            if (mean === undefined) {
                mean = 0.0;
            }
            if (stdev === undefined) {
                stdev = 1.0;
            }
            if (rnorm.v2 === null) {
                do {
                    u1 = Math.random();
                    u2 = Math.random();

                    v1 = 2 * u1 - 1;
                    v2 = 2 * u2 - 1;
                    s = v1 * v1 + v2 * v2;
                } while (s === 0 || s >= 1);

                rnorm.v2 = v2 * Math.sqrt(-2 * Math.log(s) / s);
                return stdev * v1 * Math.sqrt(-2 * Math.log(s) / s) + mean;
            }

            v2 = rnorm.v2;
            rnorm.v2 = null;
            return stdev * v2 + mean;
        }

```
Once the distribution has been selected, the parameters will be taken from the input fields
```javascript
 if (Global.currentSelection === 'abm') {

                const muInput = document.getElementById('abm-mu-input');
                const sigmaInput = document.getElementById('abm-sigma-input');

                Abm.mu = parseFloat(muInput.value);
                Abm.sigma = parseFloat(sigmaInput.value);

                c1 = new Chart(1, Global.m, Global.n, ABM);

            }

```
And a new chart will be displayed by passing (in this case ABM (arithmetic brownian motion)) the function requested. <br>
The ABM function (as the others) will contain the appropriate formula related to that distribution:
```javascript
function ABM(values, trajectory, t) {
            return values[trajectory][t - 1] + rnorm(Abm.mu * Global.dt, Abm.sigma * Math.sqrt(Global.dt));
        }

        function GBM(values, trajectory, t) {
            return values[trajectory][t - 1] * Math.exp((Gbm.mu - 0.5 * Gbm.sigma ^ 2) * Global.dt + Gbm.sigma * rnorm(Gbm.mu * Global.dt, Gbm.sigma * Math.sqrt(Global.dt)));
        }

        function Uhlenbeck(values, trajectory, t) {
            return values[trajectory][t - 1] + Uhl.theta * (Uhl.mu - values[trajectory][t - 1]) * Global.dt + Uhl.sigma * rnorm(0, Global.dt);
        }

        function Vasicek(values, trajectory, t) {
            return values[trajectory][t - 1] + Vas.a * (Vas.theta - values[trajectory][t - 1]) * Global.dt + Vas.sigma * rnorm(0, Global.dt);
        }

     .................
```

# Optional (+1 grade):
**Compare also with other possible simulation schemes which have been proposed eg, Milstein, Runge-Kutta, Heun's, ...), pointing out possible differences.**

The first list provided (as we know) consists of stochastic processes and mathematical models (commonly used in finance particularly in the context of options pricing and interest rate modeling), as deeply investigated in th8:
> <https://cheroberous.github.io/posts/th8/>
{: .prompt-tip }

a stochastic or random process is a mathematical object usually defined as a sequence of random variables, where the index of the sequence has the interpretation of time. Stochastic processes are widely used as mathematical models of systems and phenomena that appear to vary in a random manner. <br>
<br>
An SDE instead is essentially a classical differential equation which is perturbed by a random noise. When nothing else is specified, SDE means in fact ordinary SDE; in that case it corresponds to the perturbation of an ordinary differential equation. Stochastic partial differential equations (SPDEs) are obtained as random perturbation of partial differential equations (PDEs). <br>
<br>

## Approximating/Solving the SDEs
Milstein, Runge-Kutta, and Heun's methods are numerical schemes for solving stochastic differential equations (SDEs), which are often used to simulate the evolution of the underlying processes. 
### Euler's method
In mathematics and computational science, the Euler method (also called the forward Euler method) is a first-order numerical procedure for solving ordinary differential equations (ODEs) with a given initial value. It is the most basic explicit method for numerical integration of ordinary differential equations and is the simplest Runge–Kutta method. <br>
<br>
Euler’s method uses the simple formula: <br>
![image](https://github.com/Cheroberous/cheroberous.github.io/assets/102479391/5afe513f-9615-461b-8c70-8a29e82235b6)<br>
to construct the tangent at the point x and obtain the value of y(x+h), whose slope is, $\frac{dX}{dY}$ <br>
![image](https://github.com/Cheroberous/cheroberous.github.io/assets/102479391/8641f75c-b899-4a71-8f8a-6b7b5f9b2e41){: H="150"} <br>
In Euler’s method, you can approximate the curve of the solution by the tangent in each interval (that is, by a sequence of short line segments), at steps of h.

In general, if you use small step size, the accuracy of approximation increases. General formula:<br>
![image](https://github.com/Cheroberous/cheroberous.github.io/assets/102479391/8c1a2628-f357-434f-a8af-6afb38dc0c87) <br>

### Runge-Kutta method
The Runge-Kutta method attempts to overcome the problem of the Euler's method, as far as the choice of a sufficiently small step size is concerned, to reach a reasonable accuracy in the problem resolution. <br>
On the other hand, the minus of the Runge-Kutta method is that we need to calculate the increments ki involved in the numerical algorithm, enlarging the utilized workspace, generating a loss in efficiency, especially when, like in the Optimal Control theory, more variables are involved. A comparison graph: <br>

### Heun's method
In mathematics and computational science, Heun's method may refer to the improved or modified Euler's method or a similar two-stage Runge–Kutta method, is a numerical procedure for solving ordinary differential equations (ODEs) with a given initial value. 
The procedure for calculating the numerical solution to the initial value problem:

y'(t) = f(t,y(t))  $$  y\left(t_0\right)=y_0 $$
by way of Heun's method, is to first calculate the intermediate value <br>![image](https://github.com/Cheroberous/cheroberous.github.io/assets/102479391/eddbbbce-d2d0-43ec-98f9-18b3fe7f7709) <br>
and then the final approximation $ y_{i+1} $ at the next integration point. <br>

Where h is the step size and $t_{i+1}=t_i+h$

### Milstein method

The Milstein method is a numerical technique used to approximate solutions to stochastic differential equations (SDEs). It is an extension of the Euler method and is particularly useful for simulating stochastic processes with non-constant volatility.
Stochastic Differential Equation (SDE):
The Milstein method is often applied to equations of the form: <br>

dX(t)=a(X(t),t)dt+b(X(t),t)dW(t) <br>

where: 
+ X(t) is the stochastic process.
+ a(X(t),t) and b(X(t),t) are deterministic functions.
+ dW(t) is the differential of a Wiener process (Brownian motion).

The Milstein method improves the Euler method by incorporating a correction term to account for the fact that the volatility term b(X(t),t) depends on the Wiener process. The Milstein method update is given by:<br>
![image](https://github.com/Cheroberous/cheroberous.github.io/assets/102479391/95b74e13-aed1-49fd-a6e9-11b681f274d1) <br>
where b′(X(t),t) is the partial derivative of b with respect to X(t).<br>
<br>
The Milstein method provides more accurate results compared to the Euler method, especially when dealing with SDEs where the volatility term is not constant.
It is computationally efficient and widely used in financial modeling and other areas where stochastic processes are involved.

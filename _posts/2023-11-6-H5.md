# Exercise

M servers are subject to attacks during a period of time T (for instance 1 year).
Subdivide the interval T in N subinterval of size T/N and in each of this suppose that
an attack can occur with probability λ T/N.
Simulate the attacks to the M servers and represent each of them with a line which
makes jumps of 1 at each attack event.

Using the same objects ("movable/resizable rectangle", histogram, etc.) of the previous homework 3
draw vertically on the line chart the 2 histograms representing the distribution of the number
of attacks at the end of the period and one internal istant for comparison.

Study what happens asymptotically, for N large, and a number of systems M a sufficient to give shape to
a simulated distribution. Make some personal considerations about the shape and the average of the distributions that you see.

# Research
Find out on the web about a Poisson point process. See if you can see any analogy with this Exercise and verify whether your distributions come close (for N, M sufficiently large) to the theoretical asymptotic distribution

A **point process** is essentially just a collection of points randomly scattered on some **mathematical space**, such as the real line, the Cartesian plane or a sphere. <br>
The most important point process is the **Poisson point process**, which is one of the two most fundamental and studied mathematical objects in probability (The other is the Wiener process). <br>
The most important defining property of the Poisson point process is that the numbers of points of the point process located in two (or more) non-overlapping regions are two or more independent random variables. This property, sometimes called independent scattering or complete independence it is used alongside the property that the random variables have Poisson distributions to define the Poisson point process. <br>
<br>
A Poisson point process N defined on some underlying space S is a Poisson point process with intensity measure Λ if it has the two following properties:

+ The number of points in a bounded Borel set B⊂S is a Poisson random variable with mean Λ(B).

+ The number of points in n disjoint Borel sets forms n independent random variables.

The constant Λ, often denoted by λ, is known as the intensity or rate, which is often can be interpreted as the average density of points. In the exercise settings, the average density does not vary.

**If the intensity does change** over the underlying space, meaning it is spatially dependent, then the terms inhomogeneous Poisson point process or nonhomogeneous Poisson point process are used. It is usually assumed that the intensity measure Λ has a derivative λ, so it can be written as an integral: <br>
<br>
$$
Λ(B)=\int Bλ(x)\,\mathrm{d}x
$$
<!--Λ(B)=∫Bλ(x)dx, -->

where the set B is some subregion of the underlying state space S.

# Exercise

M servers are subject to attacks during a period of time T (for instance 1 year).
Subdivide the interval T in N subinterval of size T/N and in each of this suppose that
an attack can occur with probability λ T/N.
Simulate the attacks to the M servers and represent each of them with a line which
makes jumps of 1 at each attack event.

Using the same objects ("movable/resizable rectangle", histogram, etc.) of the previous homework 3
draw vertically on the line chart the 2 histograms representing the distribution of the number
of attacks at the end of the period and one internal istant for comparison.

Study what happens asymptotically, for N large, and a number of systems M a sufficient to give shape to
a simulated distribution. Make some personal considerations about the shape and the average of the distributions that you see.


## Implementation

To symplify the execution of the exercise given that each interval have the same probability of attack of the other ones,
instead of using N intervals i have devided the x axis in N "days" each one with probability $ \frac{lambda}{n_samples}$

```c#
prob_lambda = lambda / sample;
```


The function **initialize_stat**, create for each system the list of success/failed attacks and put the sum of them in som_lol.
this list will be later used to plot the related instogram
```c#
List<int> som_lol = new List<int>();

for (int i = 0; i < linee; i++)
{
    som_lol.Add(0);
    List<int> a = new List<int>();
    int local_max = 0;
    for (int j = 0; j < sample; j++)
    {

        double randomDouble = (double)rand.NextDouble();
        if (randomDouble < prob_lambda)                
        {
            a.Add(+1);
            local_max++;
            som_lol[i]++;
        }
        else
        {
            a.Add(0);
        }
    }    .........
```
The function that draw the linechart is the same of the homework 3 but the one that draws the instogram has slightly changed.
Compute_instogram
```c#
.......
int h_max= (intervalli_quanti_val.Values).Max();  // new max high for the higher rectangle


// count values in that have fallen in each interval (the number of intervals will be the number of rectangle in the instogram)
for (int j = 0; j < inter; j++)      
{
    var t = tuple_intervalli[j];

    for (int i = 0; i < val.Count; i++)
    {

        if (val[i] >= t.Item1 && val[i] < t.Item2)
        {

            intervalli_quanti_val[t]++;     // quanti di successo
        }

    }
}
........
int a = 0;
foreach (var kvp in intervalli_quanti_val)
{

    int l = (spazio_rimasto_1 * kvp.Value) / h_max;        // compute rectangle length                                 
                                                                             
    r_insto = new Rectangle(x_s, y_s - (base_rett) * (a + 1), l, base_rett);   // draw single rectangle

    g.DrawRectangle(Pens.Black, r_insto);
    g.FillRectangle(Brushes.Red, r_insto);

    a++;
}

```

##  Considerations
When M and N reach "large numbers" (as in the following image) the instogram shows that most of the sistem's sum of attacks falls in the interval that contains the **lambda** value, so most of them will receive lambda attacks if the time span is sufficiently large.
Without doing further researches is hard to establish the exact tipe of distribution i'm looking at but i would say that's a binomial. one.

# Research
Find out on the web about a Poisson point process. See if you can see any analogy with this Exercise and verify whether your distributions come close (for N, M sufficiently large) to the theoretical asymptotic distribution

A **point process** is essentially just a collection of points randomly scattered on some **mathematical space**, such as the real line, the Cartesian plane or a sphere. <br>
The most important point process is the **Poisson point process**, which is one of the two most fundamental and studied mathematical objects in probability (The other is the Wiener process). <br>
The most important defining property of the Poisson point process is that the numbers of points of the point process located in two (or more) non-overlapping regions are two or more independent random variables. This property, sometimes called independent scattering or complete independence it is used alongside the property that the random variables have Poisson distributions to define the Poisson point process. <br>
<br>
A Poisson point process N defined on some underlying space S is a Poisson point process with intensity measure Λ if it has the two following properties:

+ The number of points in a bounded Borel set B⊂S is a Poisson random variable with mean Λ(B).

+ The number of points in n disjoint Borel sets forms n independent random variables.

The constant Λ, often denoted by λ, is known as the intensity or rate, which is often can be interpreted as the average density of points. In the exercise settings, the average density does not vary.


**If the intensity does change** over the underlying space, meaning it is spatially dependent, then the terms inhomogeneous Poisson point process or nonhomogeneous Poisson point process are used. It is usually assumed that the intensity measure Λ has a derivative λ, so it can be written as an integral: <br>
<br>
$$
Λ(B)=\int Bλ(x)\,\mathrm{d}x
$$
<!--Λ(B)=∫Bλ(x)dx, -->

where the set B is some subregion of the underlying state space S. <br>

We can find applicatins in several fields, in sciencedirect.com i have found an example of use in the approximation of random synaptic input fluctuations experienced by extended neurons like neocortical pyramidal cells in vivo. <br>
Each input was modeled as a homogeneous Poisson process and any two excitatory or inhibitory inputs were weakly correlated with each other to mimic in vivo experimental observation, the standard deviation of the processes depends on the correlation level between individual excitatory and inhibitory inputs. Here's the result: <br>

## Common examples
Common examples of Poisson processes are customers calling a help center, visitors to a website, radioactive decay in atoms, photons arriving at a space telescope and movements in a stock price. Poisson processes are generally associated with time, but they don’t have to be. In the case of stock prices, we might know the average movements per day (events per time), but we could also have a Poisson process for the number of trees in an acre (events per area).

### What Is a Poisson Distribution?
The Poisson distribution and its formula helps find the probability of a given number of events in a time period (looks like our case in the practical part), or find the probability of waiting some time until the next event. As a Poisson process is a model we use for describing randomly occurring events (which by itself isn’t that useful), Poisson distribution helps to make sense of the Poisson process model.
The Poisson distribution probability mass function (pmf) gives the probability of observing k events in a time period given the length of the period and the average events per time. 
We can use the Poisson distribution pmf to find the probability of observing a number of events over an interval generated by a Poisson process. <br>
The graph below is the probability mass function of the Poisson distribution and shows the probability (y-axis) of a number of events (x-axis) occurring in one interval with different rate parameters.

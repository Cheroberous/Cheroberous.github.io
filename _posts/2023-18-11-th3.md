# The Gaussian Distribution Meaning, Derivations, Simulations

Normal distribution, also known as the **Gaussian distribution**, is a probability distribution that is symmetric about the mean, showing that data near the mean are more frequent
in occurrence than data far from the mean. In graphical form, the normal distribution appears as a "bell curve". <br>
<br>The normal distribution is the most common type of distribution assumed in technical stock market analysis and in other types of statistical analyses. The standard normal distribution has two parameters: the mean and the standard deviation.

The normal distribution model is important in statistics and is key to the Central Limit Theorem (CLT). This theory states that averages calculated from independent,
identically distributed random variables have approximately normal distributions, regardless of the type of distribution from which the variables are sampled (provided it has finite variance). (**See also th1 and th2**).

## Properties of the Normal Distribution
The normal distribution has several key features and properties that define it. <br>
First, its mean (average), median (midpoint), and mode (most frequent observation) are all equal to one another. Moreover, these values all represent the peak, or highest point, of the distribution.
The distribution then falls symmetrically around the mean, the width of which is defined by the standard deviation.

All normal distributions can be described by just two parameters: *the mean and the standard deviation.*

### The Empirical Rule
For all normal distributions, 68.2% of the observations will appear within plus or minus one standard deviation of the mean;
95.4% of the observations will fall within +/- two standard deviations; and 99.7% within +/- three standard deviations. This fact is sometimes referred to as the
"empirical rule," a heuristic that describes where most of the data in a normal distribution will appear. <br>

_This means that data falling outside of three standard deviations ("3-sigma") would signify rare occurrences._

### Skewness
Skewness measures the degree of symmetry of a distribution. The normal distribution is symmetric and has a skewness of zero.
If the distribution of a data set instead has a skewness less than zero, or negative skewness (left-skewness), then the left tail of the distribution
is longer than the right tail; positive skewness (right-skewness) implies that the right tail of the distribution is longer than the left.

## The Formula for the Normal Distribution
The normal distribution follows the following formula. Note that only the values of the mean (μ ) and standard deviation (σ) are necessary

where: <br>
+ x = value of the variable or data being examined and f(x) the probability function
+ μ = the mean
+ σ = the standard deviation


# Example of a Normal Distribution
Many naturally-occurring phenomena appear to be normally-distributed. Take, for example, the distribution of the heights of human beings.
The average height is found to be roughly 175 cm (5' 9"), counting both males and females. <br>
As the chart below shows, most people conform to that average. Meanwhile, taller and shorter people exist, but with decreasing frequency in the population.
According to the empirical rule, 99.7% of all people will fall with +/- three standard deviations of the mean, or between 154 cm (5' 0") and 196 cm (6' 5").
Those taller and shorter than this would be quite rare (just 0.15% of the population each).

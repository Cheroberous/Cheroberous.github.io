# Statistical Distributions: Continuous, Discrete, Properties and simulations

## Continuous Probability Distributions

Is a probability distribution in which the random variable X can take on any value (is continuous). 
Because there are infinite values that X could assume, the probability of X taking on any one specific value is zero. 
Therefore we often speak in ranges of values (p(X>0) = .50). The normal distribution is one example of a continuous distribution. <br>

A continuous distribution describes the probabilities of the possible values of a continuous random variable. A continuous random variable is a random variable with a set of possible values (known as the range) that is infinite and uncountable.
Probabilities of continuous random variables (X) are defined as the area under the curve of its PDF. Thus, only ranges of values can have a nonzero probability. The probability that a continuous random variable equals some value is always zero. <br>

Example of the distribution of weights
The continuous normal distribution can describe the distribution of weight of adult males. For example, you can calculate the probability that a man weighs between 160 and 170 pounds. <br>

However, the probability that X is exactly equal to some value is always zero because the area under the curve at a single point, which has no width, is zero. For example, the probability that a man weighs exactly 190 pounds to infinite precision is zero. You could calculate a nonzero probability that a man weighs more than 190 pounds, or less than 190 pounds, or between 189.9 and 190.1 pounds, but the probability that he weighs exactly 190 pounds is zero.

## Examples:

+ Normal Distribution: Describes many natural phenomena.
+ Exponential Distribution: Models the time between events in a Poisson process.
+ Uniform Distribution: Equal probability over a range.

## Properties

+ Probability Density Function (PDF): Describes the likelihood of a random variable falling within a particular range.
+ Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF): Gives the probability that a random variable takes a value less than or equal to a given point.
+ Expected Value (Mean): Represents the center of mass of the distribution.
+ Variance and Standard Deviation: Measure the spread or dispersion of the distribution.

## Discrete Probability Distribution

A discrete distribution describes the probability of occurrence of each value of a discrete random variable. A discrete random variable is a random variable that has countable values, such as a list of non-negative integers. <br>
With a discrete probability distribution, each possible value of the discrete random variable can be associated with a non-zero probability. Thus, a discrete probability distribution is often presented in tabular form.

### Example of the number of customer complaints
With a discrete distribution, unlike with a continuous distribution, you can calculate the probability that X is exactly equal to some value. For example, you can use the discrete Poisson distribution to describe the number of customer complaints within a day. Suppose the average number of complaints per day is 10 and you want to know the probability of receiving 5, 10, and 15 customer complaints in a day.

## Examples:

+ Bernoulli Distribution: Models two possible outcomes (success or failure).
+ Poisson Distribution: Models the number of events in fixed intervals of time or space.


## Properties:

+ Probability Mass Function (PMF): Gives the probability that a discrete random variable is exactly equal to a particular value.
+ Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF): Gives the probability that a random variable takes a value less than or equal to a given point.
+ Expected Value (Mean): Represents the average of the distribution.
